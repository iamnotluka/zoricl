### Combinatorics

Recently I was hustling some Leetcode questions and started warming up with some basics. 

There was one question that seemed so simple, yet gave me a flashback from my Year 11 Maths class. For some reason, I could not crack the permutations and combinations in high school.

The question was:

**If there were 5 people in the meeting, in how many different ways can people shake hands?**

Let's think about this problem logically and represent people as letters A, B, C, D and E.

In how many ways are we able to pair these.

Person A: AB, AC, AD, AE
Person B: BA, BC, BD, BE
Person C: CA, CB, CD, CE
Person D: DA, DB, DC, DE
Person E: EA, EB, EC, ED

```
const handshakes = () => {
    return n!/(n)
}
```
// Permutation and combination functions
