#### The “Grass is Greener” Situation

When building a product, losing a customer due to competition is always a possibility.

One of the interesting reasons that this happens is due to customers not actually fulfilling their desire through the product due to the lack of their input - and moving onto the competitor assuming that they will fulfil their desire with them.

Let me explain this through a couple of examples.

The first one I will mention is the most obvious one, and given my experience in the industry it is the one I see the most. It's a fitness program.

Fitness programs are a vehicle which claim to take you from being very unfit to being very fit.

You see an ad which shows a person that was once obese, unhappy and unfulfilled turn into a fit, happy and confident individual in just 2 months of following this unique program.

The claim: “Get fit and confident in 12 weeks or less.”

If you are interested, you go into the website and see that the claim to your desire is to be fulfilled through this “12 week fitness program”.

You see 100 testimonials and sign up for $129.99.

8 weeks later, you don’t actually see any results.

“This program doesn’t work!”

You give the program a 2 star review - and look for another alternative. “Grass is greener on the other side” - this other program should work for me.

The problem here is that it is not the program that is not working, it is the fact that you eat ice cream every night, drink every weekend and sleep poorly. Not to mention that you miss at least 2 workouts per week and half bake other ones. Of course the program didn’t work for you. 

Even though the grass might seem green on the other side, you still trust the claim and go to the next program, which obviously will not work again due to variables which are required for you to fulfil the claim.

Let’s look at another situation.

Recently, as a growth consultant I have been replaced by “an experienced” marketing agency. 

I was told “we need to scale quicker and I need someone who has done this previously many times before”.

Even though I’ve saved this business $100,000 in revenue per month on average.

My claim: “I’ll help you scale your company to $1 mil per month"

Mechanism: “Paid acquisition, funnels and offers”

6 months later, our partnership ended… Why? Because “grass is greener on the other side”, we are growing but not fast enough, this other agency has been doing it for 20 years, almost as long as I was alive - and they have scaled all these other companies and can do this and this and this for me. 

He was sold by the agency on the desire to hit $1 million per month.

Little does he know that for this to happen, you still need to not overhire, have scalable operations, understanding of your numbers, calculated strategy and plan, good product and product systems in place - out of which we had none of.

Edit: 7/10/25 - owner in the situation above called me to come back since nothing changed, proving my point...

There are too many variables for me as a consultant to cover in order to fulfil the desire through my mechanism.

Lastly, I will highlight someone that actually rarely deals with the “grass is greener” situation.

Jetty Cooler sells 65 liter coolers for $650.

Everyone that is using them says it’s the best shit ever. And they will never move away from them, even though the competitors sell bigger coolers for almost half the price.

Why? Because they work really well.

As a cooler customer, you want to keep you stuff cold, for as long as possible in a portable container that can fit a whole bunch of food and drinks for your trip.

So…

Claim: “We can keep your food and drinks cold for as long as possible while going on a trip.”

Mechanism: Cooler that literally takes 3 mins to set up, has 65L capacity and can last 12-14h without any issues.

So… why do customers keep using it? Because it actually does that. Mechanism fulfils that desire fully. And Jetty was able to “engineer” a product that eats complexity from the customer to the point where it’s so hard to mess up that it is essentially impossible for them to not get the most out of the product.

So let me ask you this, are there any other variables that come into play here? Put your stuff in the cooler and you’re done. A baby can do this.

Claims of desire fulfilment and mechanism that fulfils their desire are completely fulfilled. And customers stay for the ride - it doesn’t need to move onto a competitor.

So when someone asks me:

“How do you deal with the grass is greener problem”... this is the answer that I think makes most sense for now.

Grass is greener moment only happens if the desire is not fulfilled by the product.

If the desire is not fulfilled it happened to to:

- Product quality
- Miss alignment with the claim, meaning that the market message did not align with the outcome of the mechanism

The conversation here actually really is just about minimising the gap between the claim against the market desire and products ability to fulfil that desire on it’s own.

This lack of ability to fulfil is mechanisms failure to eat the complexity away from the customer (which means customers do not get results because they think that the product is going to do all of the work), or the product message fit is inaccurate which means that you are simply not taking the customer to where they want to go.

In the example of a cooler, the product fulfils the desire by essentially taking all of the complexity away from the customer - given the product is so simple, this was possible.

In the example of a fitness program and growth consulting, there are so many other variables that come into play when fulfilling the claim that you cannot fulfil the desire unless you are able to improve on the service - the current mechanism simply does not eat enough complexity away to the customer to make the “grass is greener” situation possible.

So this problem isn’t really about getting rid of the “grass is greener” situation but minimising it through product and marketing.

Assuming that the claim is the statement that resonates with the market desire, and mechanism something which fulfils that customers desire:

- Eat the complexity away from the customer completely to fulfil the desire
- Make a claim as accurate as possible to make sure that the mechanism solves the right problem / fulfils the correct desire

Eating complexity away from the customer is essentially just feedback taken into consideration led by customer centric development.

So my answer to minimising this for now is:

**Given a product, capture the market through making a claim resonating with mass desire and seek feedback from the market on how to adjust the product such that the possibility of a mechanism not fulfilling the desire on its own is minimal.**

In other words, eat away the complexity.

**Product development is a never ending quest to deliver the same desired outcome with less friction.**

**Marketing is product development.**
