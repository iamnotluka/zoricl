### Hey there! My name is Luka Zoric.

I am a software development engineer working for Amazon in Brisbane, Austraila.

This intro used to be a little different not long ago as I was fairly decent at football. However I didn't focus hard enough during injury prevention and ended up slipping into an IT role instead.

About a year ago, I gained interest in business and founded an agency which helps businesses scale through Facebook ads.

I scaled this agency to 10k/month fairly quickly but also realised it's not something I want to do full time.

I spend most of my time learning and building cool stuff.

#### Career
My career can be summed up like this:
* Moved to Brisbane with $500 in my account in the late 2019 for my intership in AECOM.

* Studied AI and Data Science while playing semi profesional footy for Holland Park Hawks FC.

* Covid happened. Focusing on studies and building personal projects, learning how to trade, do marketing and sell stuff online.

* Graduated uni in November 2020 - put "I never let school interfere with my education" in my LinkedIn bio to justify my garbage GPA.

* Worked my way into my first IT role working as a Junior JavaScript Developer with [VirtualMgr](https://virtualmgr.com/).

* Bought a house and realised that my income wont be enough so I had to look for a better job.

* Did every leet code question I could and got hired as an SDE 1 at Amazon.
