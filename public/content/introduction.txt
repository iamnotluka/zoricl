## Hey there! My name is Luka Zoric. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software development engineer working for Amazon in Brisbane, Austraila.

This intro used to be a little different not long ago as I was fairly decent at football. However I didn't focus hard enough during injury prevention and ended up slipping into an IT role instead.

I also gained interest in business about a year ago and founded an agency which helps roofing businesses scale through Facebook ads.

I spend most of my time learning and building cool stuff.
