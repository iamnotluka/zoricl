#### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software development engineer currently running FLUXO Agency and building a platform that aims to revolutionise the way people monetise and build communities online.

I am also ex-Amazon - apparently that adds street credit to my name. I spent 3 years there building cool software and learning from people better than me.

The rest of the time I have, I spend learning and building cool stuff.
