-----

#### **Late 2019: Moving to Brisbane. Internship at AECOM.**
* Have no clue what I'm doing. Working on Angular in a small team. Working on decent size components. Mostly fixing bugs and asking Peter the russian genious to fix my CSS.
* Studing AI and Data Science, playing semi-pro footy.

#### **March 2020: Plague**

* Covid happened. Lockdowns. Lots of free time. Personal projects, learning how to trade, do marketing and sell stuff online.
* Pirated Shopify dropshipping course. Built a website. Found a supplier. Messaged influencers. Sold 12 massage guns. Realised that I find reversing binary trees and solving medium Leetcode questions in Haskell is more fun.
* Graduated uni in November 2020 - put "I never let school interfere with my education" in my LinkedIn bio to justify my garbage GPA.
* Realised I'll have no real income after I graduate. Worked for free 2 days a week to learn and show company I can actually get shit done.

#### **August 2020: First Real Job.**

* Free value = job. Glad they saw I tried my best. Thanks guys!
* Junior Developer with [VirtualMgr](https://virtualmgr.com/).

#### **December 2020: Impulsive Financial Decisions**

* Bought a house and realised that my income wont be enough to survive. Started looking for a better paying job.
* Doing HackerRank, Leetcode and pramp.com 24/7. Reversing binary trees and implementing hash maps in my sleep. Hoping noone asks me what quick sort is.


#### **March 2021: FAANG**

* Did every leet code question I could and got hired as an SDE 1 at Amazon. Working in F3 (Groceries). Building cool pickup tech. Have no clue what a deployment pipeline is. Getting bullied by L5s and L6s.
* Sufered injury during my soccer game. Was pretty sad. Started treating software like it's my full time gig that it is.
* For about 12 months I was trying to survive.
* Moved to work in Compliance after 16 months. Still getting bullied by L5s and L6s.

#### **January 2023: Surviving Layoffs & Facebook Ads**

* Still working at Amazon. Yet, a little bored.
* Found out about this marketing stuff. Started learning about Facebook ads.
* Scaled to 5 figures per month (for one month - still counts). Super easy, good money, hate doing it. Again realised that reversing binary trees is where my head is at.

#### **Current: FANG**

* Worked hard to get good at software, became and SDE 2 (L5).
* Still at Amazon. Bullying L4s. Getting bullied by L6s.
