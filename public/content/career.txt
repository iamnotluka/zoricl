#### **Late 2019: Moving to Brisbane. Internship at AECOM.**
* Was unsure of my role. Worked on Angular in a small team. Focused on sizable components. Primarily fixed bugs and asked Peter, the Russian genius, to correct my CSS.
* Studied AI and Data Science, played semi-pro footy.

#### **March 2020: Plague**

* The Covid pandemic struck. Lockdowns ensued. Had ample free time. Engaged in personal projects, learned trading, marketing, and online selling.
* Accessed a Shopify dropshipping course. Built a website, found a supplier, reached out to influencers. Sold 12 massage guns. Realized that I enjoyed reversing binary trees and solving medium Leetcode questions in Haskell more.
* Graduated from uni in November 2020 - added "I never let school interfere with my education" to my LinkedIn bio to explain my less-than-stellar GPA.
* Recognized the need for a steady income post-graduation. Volunteered for free two days a week to learn and demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.

#### **August 2020: First Real Job.**

* My efforts paid off with a job offer. Grateful they recognized my dedication. Thanks, team!
* Became a Junior Developer with [VirtualMgr](https://virtualmgr.com/).

#### **December 2020: Impulsive Financial Decisions**

* Purchased a house and realized my income wouldn't suffice. Began the search for a higher-paying job.
* Engaged in HackerRank, Leetcode, and pramp.com round the clock. Dreamt of reversing binary trees and implementing hash maps. Hoped no one would quiz me on quick sort.

#### **March 2021: FAANG**

* Completed every Leetcode challenge possible and secured a position as an SDE 1 at Amazon. Worked in F3 (Groceries). Developed innovative pickup tech. Was unfamiliar with deployment pipelines. Faced challenges from L5s and L6s.
* Suffered an injury during a soccer match. Felt disheartened. Began treating software development with the seriousness it deserved.
* Spent about 12 months trying to adapt.
* Transitioned to the Compliance department after 16 months. Continued facing challenges from L5s and L6s.

#### **January 2023: Surviving Layoffs & Exploring Facebook Ads**

* Continued my tenure at Amazon but felt a tad restless.
* Discovered the world of marketing. Delved into learning about Facebook ads.
* Achieved 5 figures in monthly revenue (for one month - but it counts). While it was lucrative, I didn't enjoy it. Realized my passion still lay in tasks like reversing binary trees.

#### **Current: FANG**

* Worked diligently to hone my software skills and progressed to SDE 2 (L5).
* Remain at Amazon. Now guiding L4s while still learning from L6s.
