#### Guide to answering a coding interview question

## Note: Document under construction.

While preparing for my Amazon interview I have:

* Understood and implemented every data structure you can think of.
* Did every easy & medium leet code question on Leetcode and Hackerrank. I did a couple of hard ones but they were a struggle.
* Did a couple of competitive programming tournaments (online), didn't do to well but I was able to solve majority of the problems.

I felt like I was ready to start doing practice interviews.

While browsing on the internet I have discovered the [parmp.com](https://www.pramp.com/), mock interview practice platform. Essentially, you get matched with a person and you solve puzzle questions each, interviewing each other and giving each other feedback.

Quickly created a new account and booked every single slot you can think off.
