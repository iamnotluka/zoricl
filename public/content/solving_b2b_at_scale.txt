#### üîç Solving B2B Problems at Scale

So... have you ever wanted to start a business?

A couple of years ago, my answer to this question was a big ol' **F*CK YES, I DO.**

After a couple of years of struggle and a few too many lessons learned, I've managed to scale my agency enough to quit my $250k per year job and pursue entrepreneurial problem solving full time.

What you're about to read is purely what I would have done if I had to enter the market again and start a service-based business from the ground up...

And get the ball rolling **guaranteed**!

First up, I‚Äôll outline the steps. The rest of the blog dives deeper into each step.

Here is the game plan:
1. **Pinpoint the problem that‚Äôs begging for a solution**
2. **Figure out a solution for the problem**
3. **Craft the vehicle to deliver your solution to others (yes, that‚Äôs your product)**
4. **Measure the impact of the product**
5. **Sell the product**

To fully understand this, we‚Äôve got to break down each step with first principles thinking - basically, getting to the root of why we‚Äôre doing what we‚Äôre doing. 

Think of each step as a setup for the next step.

So, I‚Äôm taking a page from papa Jeff Bezos‚Äô playbook and starting with the customer. Not just because he swears by it but because I‚Äôve seen the impact that it has while working at Amazon. 

Amazon is now worth almost 2 trillion dollars - that‚Äôs 12 zeros. 

A thousand billion. 

Crazy if you ask me. There must be something to it.

With that in mind, let‚Äôs talk about selling a product we haven‚Äôt even built yet.

To sell effectively, we need a product that makes a measurable difference, something we shout about in our outreach and get a customer.

Picture yourself as a business owner. Someone pitches you a product. The big question in your mind most probably is - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù

From my experience, if you can‚Äôt nail that answer in one sentence, you‚Äôre likely to lose their attention. That answer needs to pack all the punch, covering the ins and outs of your offer.

So what‚Äôs the secret sauce to a killer offer? 

I‚Äôm going to borrow from Alex Hormozi‚Äôs playbook here - check out his book 100 Million Dollar Offers for the in depth stuff.

Overall, a solid offer needs to lay out the:
* Outcome
* Likelihood of Achievement
* Time delay
* Effort & Sacrifice

Let‚Äôs run through a scenario - a B2B company selling Google Ads to consultants (their product).

Now let's put ourselves in their customers shoes.

Imagine you‚Äôre a consultant named James, helping businesses streamline their sales processes. Business is steady, but you‚Äôre not swamped.

One day, you crack open your laptop and spot an unread email: ***Quick question James***

You‚Äôve seen this subject line before but curiosity wins you over, you open the email and skim it through:

***
***Hi James,***

***This is Luka from BestGoogleAdAgency, we‚Äôre all about getting more customers for consultants.***

***I can get you more customers.***

***Interested?***

***Regards,***
***Luka***
***

Would you be open to discussing this? 

Chances are slim to none.

Too many unknowns, too little time. They‚Äôve promised more clients but that‚Äôs the same ad pitch everyone out there is rolling with.

BestGoogleAdAgency has a problem. Let‚Äôs try to fix it.

## Making the Offer Irresistible

Let's help BestGoogleAdAgency polish their offer.

To reiterate:
* Business: **BestGoogleAdAgency**
* Product: **paid ads management using Google**
* Outcome: **More clients (more revenue)**

Let‚Äôs say the B2B agency wants to up their game since their inbox is a ghost town.

Here is how we can spice up the offer and make it more desirable. We‚Äôve covered the dream outcome - so by the Alex Hermozis playbook, let‚Äôs sprinkle some proof of success. 

Proof can come in many flavours, but let‚Äôs say we go with a testimonial or case study:

***We‚Äôve boosted Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base. We can do the same for you.***

It‚Äôs a good start, and adds a dash of credibility. But how many clients?

***We‚Äôve added 12 more customers to Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base. We can do the same for you.***

A dozen new clients sounds good. But then comes the kicker - when did they land those 12 clients? Last month? Over a decade? Customers want the details - this will spark the interest, but probably won‚Äôt spark enough interest for a reply or booking a call.

You can imagine what the customers are thinking - if you can do this for me in 2 weeks, I‚Äôll throw my money at you. If it‚Äôs one customer every 6 months - you know the answer.

So let‚Äôs clear that up as well:

***We‚Äôve added 12 more customers to Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base in just 2 months. We can do the same for you.***

Twelve clients in two months can mean some serious cash and a quick turnaround. The offer is getting better - our customers are actually checking out the agency's website.

The website is neat, but nothing out of the ordinary, it showcases the same testimonial and some others. The agency seems legit. The response rate kicks up a notch, but let‚Äôs see if we can make this offer irresistible.

Here is another problem - how much is each customer worth? What if those 12 customers are poor, low quality customers? Let‚Äôs address that as well.

***We‚Äôve added 12 more customers to Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base in just 2 months adding $104,000 in revenue. We can do the same for you.***

Now we‚Äôre talking.

Most businesses would find this interesting, maybe even reply or directly book a call. At very least, they will read your full email or check you out.

However, ‚Äúmaybe‚Äú should be treated as no. We want to be as certain as possible. So let‚Äôs add a final touch to make this offer a no-brainer by addressing the effort and sacrifice required:

***We‚Äôve added 12 more customers to Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base in just 2 months adding $104,000 in revenue. We can do the same for you. Just fill us in on your offer, and we‚Äôll take it from there. Plus, our pay-per-result model means you only pay us once you get paid.***

I‚Äôd be happy to hand this to a B2B agency to test out. They send you another email. 

Let‚Äôs get back to you imagining you‚Äôre a business owner:

It‚Äôs another Tuesday. 9am, you just grabbed your coffee and opened up your laptop. Outlook automatically loads and you spot a new email. It reads:

***
***Hey James,***

***Luka from BestGoogleAdAgency here. We‚Äôre the go-to for client acquisition for consultants.***

***We‚Äôve added 12 more customers to Cool Consulting Company‚Äôs client base in just 2 months adding $104,000 in revenue. We can do the same for you. Just fill us in on your offer, and we‚Äôll take it from there.***

***We work on a pay-per-result model so you only pay once you get paid.***

***Interested if I share a 3 minute video explaining what we can do for you?***

***Regards,***
***Luka***
***

Night and day difference. 

Which pitch would you be more likely to respond to?

Here is the deal, no matter what the channel, if you can‚Äôt instantly spark interest and trust, it‚Äôs all for nothing. And as you can see, the biggest differentiator was the proof of clear impact.

On top of that, trust is the linchpin here. Without solid testimonial or clear impact, it‚Äôs just an uphill battle.

We should be product led not sales led. Our product should sell itself, rather than needing constant resources thrown at sales and marketing. On top of that, once sales stop, the income stops. Just not a good situation to be in.

So why not tackle this trust thing head on?

Launching a product and carving out its market niche is not easy. Knowing this, we should just take it into consideration as early as possible.

So to sell effectively, we‚Äôve concluded that a product not only needs to hit the mark but also has a measurable impact - which here we assume is our golden ticket to fast-tracking customer acquisition.

Lesson learned:

***

In order to be able to sell effectively, you need to have a measurable impact that you can leverage in your outreach campaigns to get customers quickly.

***

I wanted to explain this as it is the last and in my opinion most important step of the business. 

If you do not have no clear way to get customers, you're potentially just wasting your time.

## Finding A Problem Worth Solving

So let‚Äôs summarise what are the things we need to have in order to execute on all previously mentioned:
* **Product**
* **Outcome**
  * Also referred by some as transformation
  * What do the customers get by using our product
* **Measurable Impact**
  * Likelihood of achievement
  * Time delay
  * Effort & sacrifice

On top of that, you need to know two things as well: 

Solution to the problem must be something desirable so that it‚Äôs scalable.

You need to build a product while solving the real problem, measure the impact and get some sort of a testimonial behind you. 

All this without wasting your time.

So how do you build a product that is solving a real, desirable problem while measuring the impact?

Here's the secret:

The easiest way to do this is by partnering with a real business - solving a real problem for them, measuring the impact of your solution and scoring that business as a testimonial. 

Win-win for both yourself and the partner business.

They get a measurable solution to their problem, you get a product, measurable impact of that product and hopefully testimonial.

So what do you do next? Here's the game plan!

### The Game Plan

These are actionable steps which should be taken to execute this properly:

1. **Pinpoint the problem that‚Äôs begging for a solution**
    1. Find a business to partner with
    2. Find out which problems they‚Äôre facing
        1. Find out where they want to be - endgame of the business (revenue, number of customers, process efficiency etc)
        2. Find out what is stopping them from getting there
        3. Learn about the industry and processes which they might be struggling with
    3. Pick a problem to solve
        1. Try to seek insight into how much impact solving the particular problem might have on their business - it is likely that other businesses are facing the similar issues
        2. Keep in mind the scalability and desirability of the solution
        1. Try to understand the complexity of the solution to the problem (why hasn‚Äôt it been solved before)
        3. Note: We do not want to be building something for 2 years
        4. Try to see how easy it is to measure to figure out the impact the solution we will have on the business
2. **Figure out a solution for the problem**
    1. Come up with a solution for that problem
        1. Confirm with the partner business that this would be something worth their time
        2. We need to get them in the game as well - it has to be worth their time so that they give effort without just playing around with us.
3. **Craft the vehicle to deliver your solution to others (yes, that‚Äôs your product)**
    1. Execute, implement and seek feedback from the partner business
4. **Measure the impact of the product**
    1. Measure the impact
5. **Sell the product**
    1. Format the offer
    2. Prepare for the launch
    3. Launch - sell at scale
    4. Ongoing
        1. Get customer feedback
        2. Incorporate customer feedback
        3. Repeat

Obviously, this does not guarantee success but allows us to build a product that at least solves the real problem.
