#### ðŸ’­ Placebo Effect of Positive Thinking

The concept of positivity is often linked to topics such as the Law of Attraction or The Secret. The idea is simple: if you think good things will happen, they will.

I've never fully believed this, yet the more I experience life, the more I think there's something to it.

In 1988, Rene Peoc'h conducted an experiment to test the possible psychokinetic influence of chicks on a robot's random movements. The robot, equipped with a lighted candle, moved randomly in a defined area in an otherwise darkened room.

For the experiment, scientists exposed newly born chicks to this moving robot. Typically, young chicks associate the first moving object they see with their mother. The assumption was that the chicks, wanting to be near their 'mother', would influence the robot to stay close to them.

After bonding, the chicks were removed from the robot and placed in a cage adjacent to the area where the robot moved randomly.

The movements of the robot were recorded both with and without the chicks in the vicinity, over 100 trials.

The result? There was statistically significant data suggesting that in the absence of the chicks, the robot followed random trajectories. However, when lighted and exposed to the chicks, the robot seemed to spend excessive time near them.

The chicks, merely by wanting the robot to be near them, appeared to affect its movements.

Very strange and interesting. You can find the full study [here](https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/9/jse_09_2_peoch.pdf).

So...

Does thinking about good things make them happen?

Most people would dismiss this as nonsense.

I'm skeptical too, as there are many flaws in this experiment that come to mind immediately.

However, what I find interesting is not the study's result, but people's reactions to such ideas.

Some dismiss these studies outright, while others believe wholeheartedly that their thoughts can alter reality.

This delusional confidence and naivety can reinforce positive thoughts, leading to less self-sabotage in the form of doubt, resulting in better and more consistent work, and ultimately, greater success.

At the high level:

Success is a result of good outcomes.

Good outcomes are result of correct energy input.

Correct energy input is a cause of doing the work correctly.

To do things correctly you need to figure out what that looks like.

To figure out the right thing to do, you either learn from others or discover it yourself through trial and error.

Either way, you need to put in the hard yards and hustle to create a set of actions that will generate the desired result.

This takes:
* Consistency and positive reinforcement
* Positive feedback loops
* Taking action, observing results, recieving feedback, refining future actions.
* etc...

Nothing in life is definite, so even with all this in place, you can't guarantee things will work out exactly as you want. However, you are more likely to persevere in your efforts with a bit of delusional confidence, faith, and naivety, thereby maximizing the probability of achieving your desired outcome.

I believe that the Law of Attraction and The Secret represent a mindset shift. 

It's not that believing in something allows you to attract it, but that the belief itself enables you to persist long enough to see results.

So, to sum it up:

Delusional confidence lead to longer periods of consistency.

Consistency lead to figuring things out.

Figuring things out lead to knowing how to do things properly.

Knowing how to do things properly lead to better energy input.

Better energy input lead to better outcomes.

Better outcomes lead to success.

This is my theory on why many successful people advocate for the Law of Attraction. Delusional confidence worked for them. Most people quit too early because they lack the belief that their actions will lead them to their desired destination.

On a side note, this has also led me to shift from being an atheist. It turns out that learning how to believe without evidence will simply only benefit you.

Success is not guaranteed, but you're more likely to be successful if you believe you will be.

Think positively, and things might just turn out the way you want them to.
